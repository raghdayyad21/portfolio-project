# This project is a simple personal portfolio website created to practice Git and GitHub workflows.
The website includes a home page, an about page, a contact page, and a blog section that displays professional blog post previews.
All pages are styled using a shared CSS file to maintain a consistent and clean design.
The project follows a structured GitFlow-style workflow using feature, develop, release, and hotfix branches.
